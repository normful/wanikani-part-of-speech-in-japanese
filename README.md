# WaniKani Part of Speech in Japanese

This shows the part of speech for WaniKani vocabulary using Japanese grammar wards, instead of English ones.

This is a fork of @jeshuam 's code from https://community.wanikani.com/t/userscript-wanikani-part-of-speech/4783

(Note: This single giant file has a ton of WWWJDIC EDICT inlined and exceeds the Greasy Fork script size limit, so it can't be uploaded there.)
